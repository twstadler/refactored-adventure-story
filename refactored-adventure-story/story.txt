In a world where zombies roam freely looking for their pray, 
Sampson desperately attempts to build a shelter. 
Sampson searches the country side for material sturdy enough to resist the hoards of undead that constatntly hunt him. 
Unfourtunately for Sampson he is unable to find such material and is left to fend for himself in an unforgiving world.

While searching his surroundings for something to protect himself with, Sampson is ambushed by two zombies from behind.
Quickly, Sampson kicks the one closest to him away, then runs in the opposite direction to control his spacing.
Sampson was pushed into a corner. He notices that there is a sword in the corner, and reaches for it.

As he grabs the swords it starts slipping from his hand, and he soon realizes that it is convered in blood.
 Trying not to think of whose blood that could be, Samsung refocused his  attention on the uncoming zombie coming towards him. 
Fearing for his life, Samsung charged at the zombie, swingly randomly, hoping to God that he hits a vital part of the zombie.
Before he knows it the sword enters the zomibes chest.
